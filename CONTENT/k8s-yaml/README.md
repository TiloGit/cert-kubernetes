# Deploying with YAML files

## Requirements and Prerequisites

Ensure that you have completed the following tasks:

- [Preparing your Kubernetes server](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/k8s_topics/tsk_prepare_env_k8s.html)
- [Downloading the PPA archive](../../README.md)
- [Preparing FileNet environment](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/k8s_topics/tsk_prepare_ecmk8s.html) 

## Deploying component images

Use the command line to deploy the image using the parameters in the appropriate YAML file. You also use the command line to determine access information for your deployed images.

To deploy Content Platform Engine: 
 1. Use the deployment file to deploy Content Platform Engine:
    
    ```kubectl apply -f cpe-deploy.yml```
 2. Run following command to get the Public IP and port to access Content Platform Engine:
    
    ```kubectl get svc | grep ecm-cpe```

To deploy Content Search Services:
 1. Use the deployment file to deploy Content Search Services:
    
    ```kubectl apply -f css-deploy.yml```
 2. Run the following command to get the Public IP and port to access Content Search Services:
   
   ```kubectl get svc | grep ecm-css```

To deploy Content Management Interoperability Services:
 1. Use the deployment file to deploy Content Management Interoperability Services:
    
    ```kubectl apply -f css-deploy.yml```
 2. Run the following command to get the Public IP and port to access Content Management Interoperability Services:
    
    ```kubectl get svc | ecm-cmis```


> **Reminder**: After you deploy, return to the instructions in the Knowledge Center, [Completing post deployment tasks for IBM FileNet Content Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/k8s_topics/tsk_deploy_postecmdeployk8s.html), to get your FileNet Content Manager environment up and running

## Uninstalling a Kubernetes release of FileNet Content Manager

To uninstall and delete the Content Platform Engine release, use the following command:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f <cpe-deploy.yml>
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the release, except any Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).  This is the default behavior of Kubernetes, and ensures that valuable data is not deleted. To delete the persisted data of the release, you can delete the PVC using the following command:

```console
$ kubectl delete pvc my-cpe-prod-release-cpe-pvclaim
```
Repeat the process for any other deployments that you want to delete.
