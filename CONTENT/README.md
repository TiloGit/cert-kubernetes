## Requirements and Prerequisites

Perform the following tasks to prepare to deploy your FileNet Content Manager images on Kubernetes:

- Prepare your Kubernetes environment. See [Preparing to install automation containers on Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/k8s_topics/tsk_prepare_env_k8s.html)

- Download the PPA. Refer to the top repository [readme](../README.md) to find instructions on how to push and tag the product container images to your Docker registry.

- Prepare your FileNet Content Manager environment. These procedures include setting up databases, LDAP, storage, and configuration files that are required for use and operation. If you plan to use the YAML file method, you also create YAML files that include the applicable parameter values for your deployment. You must complete all of the [preparation steps for FileNet Content Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/k8s_topics/tsk_prepare_ecmk8s.html) before you are ready to deploy the container images. 


## Deploying

You can deploy your container images with the following methods:

- [Using Helm charts](helm-charts/README.md)
- [Using Kubernetes YAML](k8s-yaml/README.md)

## Completing post deployment configuration

After you deploy your container images, you perform some required and some optional steps to get your FileNet Content Manager environment up and running. For detailed instructions, see [Completing post deployment tasks for IBM FileNet Content Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSYHZ8_18.0.x/com.ibm.dba.install/k8s_topics/tsk_deploy_postecmdeployk8s.html)
